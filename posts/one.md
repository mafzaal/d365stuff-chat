description: Welcome to the greatest collection of AX and D365 stuff ever.  The focus will be
on making things you have to do all the time that shouldn&#x27;t be hard, but are
hard, not so hard.  It could be made even easier, but then you&#x27;ll never learn.
 It&#x27;s impossible to learn if it doesn&#x27;t hurt at least a little, so all code
snippets will be images that you have to type again by hand.  Don&#x27;t type them
too fast; explore the objects as they open up.

# One

Welcome to the greatest collection of AX and D365 stuff ever. The focus will
be on making things you have to do all the time that shouldn't be hard, but
are hard, not so hard. It could be made even easier, but then you'll never
learn. It's impossible to learn if it doesn't hurt at least a little, so all
code snippets will be images that you have to type again by hand. Don't type
them too fast; explore the objects as they open up.
