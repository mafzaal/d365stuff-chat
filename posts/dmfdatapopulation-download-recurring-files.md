# DMFDataPopulation - Download Recurring Files

Integrations are a lot of work. No matter how good you are, the project will
never come together without great planning, transparency, and teamwork from
all parties. In the ERP world, they can be like turning off all the lights in
a gymnasium, and then trying to do-si-do while performing Masonic handshakes
with your partner 1000 times per minute with your hands on the floor and your
feet in the air.

Once files are submitted to your D365 recurring integration, it's easy for
them to get lost in the cloud. You can always see how data looks like in
staging tables, but what about how it looks before that? What if you want to
download and see the file your dance partner catapulted to you? Make a button.

As long as you can divine the execution record, you can pass it to the
DMFDataPopulation class to get a URL to download the file.
