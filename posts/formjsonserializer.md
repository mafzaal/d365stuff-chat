What&#x27;s the competition?

You could write your own class and reinvent the wheel.

You could be like the retail team and use the RetailTransactionServiceJsonHelper
class but it&#x27;s fussier.

You could stop here and just use FormJsonSerializer

# FormJsonSerializer

The FormJsonSerializer class is the one true JSON serializer in D365. The
static serializeClass() method is the simplest to implement, and can handle
the most complex of contracts. If you want to get wild, set a breakpoint and
load D365 in a new browser tab.

What's the competition?

You could write your own class and reinvent the wheel.

You could be like the retail team and use the
RetailTransactionServiceJsonHelper class but it's fussier.

You could stop here and just use FormJsonSerializer.
