# Run Multiple Instances of Teams

I never thought I'd get this (in their words) "hack" from a supply chain
consultant, but apparently anything is possible in 2020. Here is a great way
to run multiple desktop Teams clients at the same time.

Copy and paste the following into a text editor:

    
    
    @ECHO OFF
    
    REM Uses the file name as the profile name
    SET MSTEAMS_PROFILE=%~n0
    ECHO - Using profile "%MSTEAMS_PROFILE%"
    
    SET "OLD_USERPROFILE=%USERPROFILE%"
    SET "USERPROFILE=%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Teams\CustomProfiles\%MSTEAMS_PROFILE%"
    
    ECHO - Launching MS Teams with profile %MSTEAMS_PROFILE%
    cd "%OLD_USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Teams"
    "%OLD_USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Teams\Update.exe" --processStart "Teams.exe"
    

Name the file whatever you want, and give it a .cmd extension.

Now with a mere double click, I can have two desktop Teams clients open, at
the same time. In this example, I have my work account open and a guest
account open for a customer:
