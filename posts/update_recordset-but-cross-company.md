you&#x27;ll have to:

You could skip more, but you can&#x27;t skip less.

# update_recordset, but cross-company

You write some nice speedy sql cross company code, it compiles, and then your
good mood gets wiped away with an awful run-time error. You fix that error,
and get another one. And then another one. Depending on your luck, your fourth
iteration will work. Just do it right the first time. At the very least,
you'll have to:

  * skipDatabaseLog
  * skipAOSValidation
  * skipDataMethods
  * skipEvents

You could skip more, but you can't skip less.
