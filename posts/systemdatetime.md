# System.DateTime

There are enough x++ date and time functions to do just about anything, but
sometimes they can make simple tasks fussy, and lack precision. I was
investigating how to bring in [at least] milliseconds into my my timestamps,
and ran across the DateTime [struct](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-
us/dotnet/api/system.datetime?view=netframework-4.8&ref=d365stuff.co) and its
[methods](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-
us/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/system-datetime-
methods?ref=d365stuff.co).

Not only does it make a lot of date components easily accessible, but it has
the day of year, millisecond, and tick measures of time. It's the little
things.
