to the invoice.

copy the event handler method:

# ... does not implement the delegate
'convertPurchTableFieldToVendInvoiceDelegate'

This is a fun surprise that can take a bit of digging. When adding fields to
the PurchTable table's HeaderToLineUpdate field group, this error can pop up
if they aren't accounted for in the convertPurchTableFieldToVendInvoice
delegate, which is part of the VendInvoiceTableToLineUpdate class which copies
PO fields to the invoice.

The first step in subscribing is to find the class' delegate in the Designer
and copy the event handler method:

Next, paste that method into a new class:

    
    
    d365StuffClass
    {
    	[SubscribesTo(classStr(VendInvoiceTableToLineUpdate), staticDelegateStr(VendInvoiceTableToLineUpdate, convertPurchTableFieldToVendInvoiceDelegate))]
    	public static void VendInvoiceTableToLineUpdate_convertPurchTableFieldToVendInvoiceDelegate(FieldId _purchTableFieldId, EventHandlerResult _result)
    	{
    		switch(_purchTableFieldId)
    		{
    			case fieldNum(PurchTable, DlvMode):
    				_result.result(0);
    							break;
    		}
    	}
    }

In this example, I'm adding a condition for the DlvMode field. I don't want it
to copy to the invoice, so I'm setting the result to 0.
