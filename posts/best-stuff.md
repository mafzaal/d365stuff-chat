description: Sometimes we need great tools beyond Visual Studio and the cloud.  Here is an
ongoing list of the best stuff:

Agent Ransack

Agent Ransack is what Windows Search dreams of being.  It&#x27;s the best way to
search through files in a folder structure.  Trying to find a specific order in
an endless sea of XML files? Ransack it.  Trying to find instances of D365 code
in your Dev VM? Point Ransack to PackagesLocalDirectory, or a specific model
[folder] of your choice.

# Best Stuff

Sometimes we need great tools beyond Visual Studio and the cloud. Here is an
ongoing list of the best stuff:

**Agent Ransack**

Agent Ransack is what Windows Search dreams of being. It's the best way to
search through files in a folder structure. Trying to find a specific order in
an endless sea of XML files? Ransack it. Trying to find instances of D365 code
in your Dev VM? Point Ransack to PackagesLocalDirectory, or a specific model
[folder] of your choice.

**WinMerge**

WinMerge is great at two things, which I really consider one thing – the
differencing and merging files and folders. You probably rarely have to do
this one thing, but when you do, you'll thank whatever you thank for open
source software.

Can be found at:

sea2](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winmerge/files/stable/2.16.0/WinMerge-2.16.0-Setup.exe/download?use_mirror=superb-
sea2&ref=d365stuff.co)

**Notepad++**

The best text editor.

**Postman**

Test your APIs.

**Fiddler**

The best in web debugging; install it on your Dev VM. You can also test your
APIs.

**Sudden Coffee**

Not downloadable, but it could save your life. You will inevitably find
yourself in a professional scenario with no good coffee to be found. Be
prepared.
